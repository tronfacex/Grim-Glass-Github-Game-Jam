# Grim-Glass-Github-Game-Jam
This is the corresponding open repository for the game I submitted to the Github Gameoff 2023.

You can play the game here: [Grim and Glass](https://tfxgames.itch.io/grim-and-glass)

I think this project represents my current intermediate understanding of C# and Unity. It is also a mess and quite representative of the type of build fast mentality that comes with game jamming.
